# Knowledge-Graph-and-GraphDb

The notebook  focuses on configuring and integrating a Neo4j graph database with the Langchain framework. Here's what the code does:

## Library Installation

The notebook begins by installing the necessary Python packages, including langchain, langchain-community, and neo4j. These packages are required to interact with the Neo4j database and to utilize the Langchain framework for processing.

## Environment Variable Setup

It sets up placeholders for environment variables that store the connection details for the Neo4j database, such as the URI, username, and password. These details are crucial for establishing a secure connection to the database.

## Environment Configuration

The notebook configures the environment by assigning the values of the Neo4j connection details to the respective environment variables. This ensures that the connection details are accessible throughout the session.

## Neo4j Integration with Langchain

The notebook imports the Neo4jGraph class from the langchain_community.graphs module and then creates an instance of Neo4jGraph using the connection details provided earlier. This step establishes a connection to the Neo4j database, allowing for interaction with the graph data through Langchain.
